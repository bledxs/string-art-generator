## The Three Golden Rules

Before uploading any image, ask:

### 1. Is There Strong Contrast?

String art is **grayscale by nature** - it creates depth through line density, not color. Your image needs:

✅ **Bright highlights** (will remain mostly empty)  
✅ **Deep shadows** (will get dense thread coverage)  
✅ **Clear separation** between light and dark areas

❌ **Avoid:**
- Uniformly lit photos (no drama)
- Low-contrast pastel images
- Heavily filtered photos with crushed shadows

**Quick test:** Convert your image to grayscale. If it loses visual impact, it won't work well for string art.

### 2. Is the Subject Clear and Simple?

The algorithm traces **dominant shapes**, not fine details. Ideal subjects have:

✅ **Bold, recognizable forms**  
✅ **Clean edges and outlines**  
✅ **Minimal background clutter**  
✅ **Single focal point**

❌ **Avoid:**
- Busy backgrounds with competing elements
- Multiple subjects of equal importance
- Extremely fine textures (lace, grass, fur)
- Tiny text or intricate patterns

**Quick test:** Squint at your image. If you can't identify the subject with blurred vision, it's too complex.

### 3. Is the Composition Circular-Friendly?

String art uses a **circular boundary**. This works best with:

✅ **Centered subjects** (faces, logos, single objects)  
✅ **Square or circular crops** (1:1 aspect ratio)  
✅ **Subjects that fit within a circle** without awkward cropping

❌ **Avoid:**
- Wide panoramic images (forces awkward cropping)
- Subjects in extreme corners
- Horizontal or vertical compositions that don't crop well to square

**Quick test:** Use a circular cookie cutter or jar lid on your phone screen. Does the important content fit inside the circle?

## Image Types Ranked

### Excellent Choices (90-100% Success Rate)

**1. High-Contrast Portraits**

Best practices:
- Professional headshots with dramatic lighting
- Side lighting creating strong shadows
- Dark background, light-skinned subject (or inverse)
- Face fills 60-80% of frame
- Clear eye and mouth definition

**Examples that work:**
- Black & white actor headshots
- Rembrandt-lit portraits (triangular light on cheek)
- Silhouettes against bright backgrounds

**2. Bold Logos and Icons**

Best practices:
- Simple shapes (Apple logo, Nike swoosh)
- Thick lines (not thin wireframes)
- Solid fills (not gradients)
- High contrast against background
- No fine text

**Examples that work:**
- Corporate logos (Tesla, Starbucks, Target)
- Highway signs (yield, stop, warnings)
- Simple icons (hearts, stars, anchors)

**3. Clean Silhouettes**

Best practices:
- Profile views of people/animals
- Objects with distinctive outlines
- 100% black subject on white background
- Interesting negative space
- No internal detail needed

**Examples that work:**
- Tree silhouettes at sunset
- Profile portraits (think coin/cameo style)
- Recognizable object outlines (guitar, Eiffel Tower)

### Good Choices (70-85% Success Rate)

**4. Animals with Clear Features**

Best practices:
- Close-up shots (head and shoulders)
- Short-haired breeds (avoid fluffy)
- Strong eye contrast
- Solid background
- Frontal or 3/4 view

**Examples that work:**
- Dog portraits (Labrador, Doberman - not Poodle, Shih Tzu)
- Big cats (lions, tigers) with distinct manes
- Birds with bold markings (eagles, owls)

**Challenges:**
- Fine fur creates noise
- Similar tones for body and background
- Too much detail in feathers/fur texture

**5. Architectural Details**

Best practices:
- Strong geometric lines
- Dramatic perspective
- Clear light/shadow areas
- Minimal sky (solid white better)
- Interesting structural elements

**Examples that work:**
- Gothic cathedral facades
- Modern skyscraper angles
- Bridge structures (Golden Gate, Brooklyn)

**Challenges:**
- Windows can create repetitive noise
- Backgrounds often too busy
- May need heavy preprocessing

### Challenging (40-60% Success Rate)

**6. Landscapes**

Best practices:
- Dramatic foreground element (tree, rock formation)
- Strong horizon line
- High-contrast sky (stormy clouds)
- Simplified background
- Minimal mid-tone areas

**Examples that work:**
- Lone tree on hill against sunset
- Mountain peaks with clear sky
- Desert formations with deep shadows

**Challenges:**
- Too many tonal ranges
- Grass/foliage creates texture noise
- Often lacks focal point
- Requires extensive preprocessing

**7. Full-Body Portraits**

Best practices:
- Distinct pose (not standing straight)
- Simple clothing (not patterns)
- Clean background
- Adequate contrast throughout figure
- Interesting silhouette

**Challenges:**
- Smaller face detail
- More area to cover = more lines needed
- Harder to balance detail across entire figure

### Poor Choices (10-30% Success Rate)

**8. Text and Typography**

Why it's difficult:
- Thin letterforms disappear
- Requires extreme precision
- Curves in letters are challenging
- Small text is nearly impossible

**If you must try:**
- Use bold, thick fonts (Impact, Helvetica Bold)
- Large lettering only (2-3 letters max)
- Extremely high contrast
- Simple sans-serif styles

**9. Group Photos**

Why it's difficult:
- Multiple focal points compete
- Faces become too small
- Background dominates
- Tonal balance is nearly impossible

**Alternative:** Crop to single person for better results

**10. Color-Dependent Images**

Why it's difficult:
- String art is monochrome
- Color contrast ≠ grayscale contrast
- Loses all meaning when converted to grayscale

**Example:** Red apple on green grass looks distinct in color but turns uniform gray in monochrome.

## Pre-Processing: Transform Good to Great

Even perfect subjects benefit from **digital preprocessing** before upload.

### Step 1: Crop to Square (1:1 Ratio)

**Why:** String art uses circular boundaries; square crops waste less space.

**How:**
- Use phone's built-in crop tool
- Select "Square" or "1:1" aspect ratio
- Center the main subject
- Eliminate distracting edges

### Step 2: Convert to Grayscale

**Why:** Preview exactly how the algorithm will see your image.

**How:**
- iOS: Photos app → Edit → Filters → Mono/Noir
- Android: Google Photos → Edit → Filters → B&W
- Desktop: Any photo editor → Desaturate/Grayscale

**Evaluate:** If the image loses impact, choose a different photo.

### Step 3: Increase Contrast

**Why:** Amplifies difference between light and dark areas.

**How:**
- Photos app: Increase Contrast slider (+30 to +50)
- Advanced: Adjust Curves for S-shaped curve
- Mobile apps: Snapseed → Tools → Tune Image → Contrast

**Warning:** Don't overdo it - aim for dramatic but not posterized.

### Step 4: Dodge and Burn (Advanced)

**Why:** Manually lighten highlights and darken shadows.

**How:**
- Use Snapseed's Selective tool
- Add point to bright areas → increase brightness
- Add point to dark areas → decrease brightness
- Creates localized contrast

### Step 5: Remove Background (Optional)

**Why:** Eliminates distractions, ensures subject pops.

**How:**
- Use remove.bg (free web tool)
- Replace background with solid white or black
- Ensures clean circular composition

**Best for:** Portraits, products, animals

### Step 6: Apply Threshold (Advanced)

**Why:** Converts to pure black/white, eliminating mid-tones.

**How:**
- Photoshop: Image → Adjustments → Threshold
- Adjust slider until subject is clear black
- Background should be pure white

**Best for:** Logos, icons, silhouettes  
**Avoid for:** Portraits (loses subtle detail)

## Image Checklist

Before uploading, verify:

☑ **Converted to grayscale** - Still looks impactful?  
☑ **High contrast** - Clear difference between light/dark?  
☑ **Simple subject** - One clear focal point?  
☑ **Clean background** - No distracting elements?  
☑ **Cropped to square** - Subject centered in 1:1 ratio?  
☑ **Minimum 300x300 pixels** - Adequate resolution?  
☑ **Clear edges** - Subject distinct from background?  
☑ **Appropriate size** - Subject fills 60-80% of frame?

**8 out of 8 = Excellent candidate**  
**6-7 out of 8 = Will likely work well**  
**4-5 out of 8 = May need more preprocessing**  
**&lt;4 out of 8 = Consider different image**

## Common Image Problems (and Fixes)

### Problem: "My portrait looks flat"

**Causes:**
- Even, frontal lighting (no shadows)
- Low contrast between face and background
- Uniformly mid-tone throughout

**Fixes:**
- Find image with side/dramatic lighting
- Use Dodge tool to brighten one side of face
- Burn tool to darken background
- Increase overall contrast +40%

### Problem: "The background is too busy"

**Causes:**
- Multiple elements competing for attention
- Texture noise (trees, grass, patterns)
- Similar tones to main subject

**Fixes:**
- Use background removal tool (remove.bg)
- Replace with solid white/black
- Blur background heavily (Gaussian blur, radius 50+)
- Crop tighter to eliminate background entirely

### Problem: "Details are getting lost"

**Causes:**
- Subject too small in frame
- Too many fine details (hair, texture)
- Insufficient contrast in critical areas

**Fixes:**
- Crop tighter - subject should fill 70%+ of frame
- Increase local contrast around important features (eyes, mouth)
- Simplify: remove fine details that won't translate (thin hair strands)

### Problem: "Grayscale conversion looks muddy"

**Causes:**
- Original colors had similar luminance values
- Heavy midtones, lacking deep blacks or bright whites

**Fixes:**
- Adjust grayscale conversion method (Red/Green/Blue channel mixing)
- Apply Levels adjustment: move black point right, white point left
- Use Threshold on copy layer to identify where true blacks/whites should be

## Testing Your Image

### The Squint Test

1. Display image on screen
2. Squint or blur your vision
3. Can you still identify the subject?

**Pass:** Shapes remain recognizable → Good candidate  
**Fail:** Becomes indistinct blob → Needs more contrast or simpler subject

### The Thumbnail Test

1. Shrink image to thumbnail size (100x100px)
2. View from 6 feet away

**Pass:** Subject still clear → Excellent candidate  
**Fail:** Details vanish → Subject too complex

### The Cookie Cutter Test

1. Place circular object over image (physical or digital)
2. Does key content fit without awkward cropping?

**Pass:** Subject fits naturally → Good composition  
**Fail:** Important parts cut off → Recrop or choose different image

## Real Examples: Before and After

### Example 1: Portrait Improvement

**Before (Poor choice):**
- Evenly lit selfie
- Busy background (bookshelf)
- Low contrast (soft lighting)
- Subject small in frame

**After (Excellent):**
- Cropped to shoulders-up
- Background removed (solid white)
- Contrast +50%
- Dodged highlights on face
- Burned shadows under chin

**Result:** Went from 40% detail capture to 90%

### Example 2: Logo Optimization

**Before (Mediocre):**
- Gradient background
- Logo with thin lines
- Low resolution (150x150px)
- Color-based design

**After (Perfect):**
- Threshold applied (pure black/white)
- Upscaled to 500x500px
- Simplified thin elements
- Solid white background

**Result:** Crisp, high-contrast output

## When to Walk Away

Some images simply won't work, no matter how much preprocessing:

**Irredeemable:**
- Images relying purely on color contrast
- Extreme low-light photos (too much noise)
- Complex patterns (paisley, floral, geometric)
- Very low resolution (&lt;200x200px)
- Multiple equal subjects (group uniformity)

**Better choice:** Find a different image that meets the criteria naturally rather than fighting to make a poor candidate work.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right image is **50% of success** in string art. The algorithm is powerful, but it needs good source material to create stunning results.

**Perfect candidates:**
- High contrast
- Simple, clear subjects
- Circular-friendly composition
- Minimal backgrounds
- Bold forms over fine details

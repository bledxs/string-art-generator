## Production and Workflow

### Efficient Production Process

**Batch Your Work:**

Instead of start-to-finish on one piece, batch similar tasks:

**Weekly Production Schedule:**

**Monday: Prep Day**

- Cut all boards for week's orders
- Sand all boards
- Stain boards (let dry overnight)

**Tuesday: First Seal**

- Apply first coat polyurethane to all boards
- Generate and print patterns
- Inventory check and material orders

**Wednesday: Pin Prep**

- Apply remaining coats polyurethane
- Mark all pin positions on cured boards
- Drill all pilot holes
- Install all pins on all boards

**Thursday-Friday: Stringing**

- String multiple pieces
- Work in 2-3 hour blocks per piece
- Save similar complexity pieces for same session

**Saturday: Finishing**

- Secure all string ends
- Final cleanup
- Apply protective coating
- Photography

**Sunday: Admin**

- Edit photos
- List new pieces
- Social media content creation
- Customer communications

**Time Savings with Batching:**

- 30-40% reduction in total time
- Fewer setup/cleanup cycles
- Better focus on single task
- More consistent quality

### Templates and Standardization

**Create Product Lines:**

Instead of every piece being custom, offer standard designs:

**Portrait Line:**

- 3 sizes: 16", 20", 24"
- Standard pin counts: 200, 250, 300
- Customer sends photo, you use proven parameters
- Consistent pricing and timeline

**Quote Line:**

- Popular quotes/sayings
- Standardized layouts
- Pre-generated patterns
- Quick turnaround (2-3 days)
- Lower price, higher volume

**Logo Line:**

- Popular logos (sports teams, brands, symbols)
- Pre-made patterns
- Batch produce for inventory
- Sell ready-made

**Savings:**

- No design time per order
- Predictable materials and labor
- Can pre-produce
- Faster customer decision (seeing exact product)

### Photography Standards

Professional photos are non-negotiable for online sales.

**Essential Setup:**

**Equipment (Budget: $50-150):**

- Smartphone camera (current phone is fine)
- White backdrop (poster board or fabric)
- 2-3 clamp lights with daylight bulbs
- Tripod or phone mount
- Tape or pins to hang pieces

**Photography Checklist:**

- Clean, dust-free piece
- Straight-on angle (camera level with center)
- Even lighting (no harsh shadows)
- White balance correct (whites look white, not yellow)
- Fill the frame (piece takes up 70-80%)
- Multiple angles (front, 45°, close-up detail)
- Scale reference (in room or with common object)

**Editing:**

- Basic adjustments only (brightness, contrast)
- Don't over-filter or heavily edit
- Accurate color representation
- Crop to focus on piece
- Free tools: Snapseed, Lightroom Mobile, Photopea

### Packaging and Shipping

**Packaging Requirements:**

String art is fragile—pins can bend, strings can break.

**Packing Method:**

1. **Wrap piece face-down in bubble wrap (3-4 layers)**
2. **Cut cardboard to fit over back (reinforcement)**
3. **Place in box with 2-3 inches clearance all sides**
4. **Fill void with packing peanuts, bubble wrap, or crumpled paper**
5. **Mark package: FRAGILE - HANDMADE ART - THIS SIDE UP**

**Box Sizes and Costs:**

```
12-16" pieces:
- Box: 18" × 18" × 4" ($2-4)
- Shipping: $12-20 (USPS Priority or UPS Ground)

20-24" pieces:
- Box: 26" × 26" × 4" ($4-7)
- Shipping: $20-35

30"+ pieces:
- Custom box or multiple boxes
- Shipping: $35-60
- Consider local delivery or pickup only
```

**Insurance:**

- Always add insurance for value over $100
- Cost: ~$2-5 per $100 value
- Protects your business and customer

**Shipping Policy:**

- Build shipping cost into price OR charge separately (be upfront)
- Offer local pickup (saves both of you money)
- Set expectations: "Carefully packaged, typically arrives in 5-7 business days"
- Follow up: "Has your piece arrived safely?"

## Customer Management

```

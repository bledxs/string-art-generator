## Choosing Your First Design

### Start Simple, Not Ambitious

**Recommended first projects:**

✅ **Simple logo or icon** (Apple logo, heart shape, star)  
✅ **Silhouette portrait** (profile view, high contrast)  
✅ **Abstract geometric pattern**  
✅ **Single letter or initial**

❌ **Avoid for first project:**

- Full-face portraits (too much detail)
- Landscapes (complex tonal ranges)
- Small text (requires precision)
- Multi-color designs (add complexity)

### The Sweet Spot Parameters

For your first build, use these proven beginner settings:

- **Pins:** 150-200 (manageable quantity)
- **Lines:** 2,000-3,000 (achievable in one session)
- **Image size:** 300x300 pixels minimum
- **Circle diameter:** 16-20 inches (40-50 cm)

**Why these numbers?**

- 150 pins = ~30 minutes to hammer
- 2,500 lines = 2-3 hours to string
- Total time: 3-4 hours (doable in one day)

## Essential Materials Checklist

### The Basics ($15-25 USD)

**Board:**

- ☑ 18" x 18" wood board (½" thick plywood or MDF)
- ☑ Pre-cut circles available at craft stores
- ☑ Alternative: Cork board (easier nailing, less durable)

**Fasteners:**

- ☑ 1" finishing nails or panel pins (200 count)
- ☑ OR push pins for cork boards
- ☑ All same size for uniform height

**Thread:**

- ☑ Black sewing thread (standard weight)
- ☑ Alternative: Embroidery floss (1-2 strands)
- ☑ Buy 2-3 spools (you'll need ~300-500 yards)

**Tools:**

- ☑ Small hammer (8-12 oz)
- ☑ Measuring tape or ruler
- ☑ Pencil
- ☑ Scissors
- ☑ Tape (to secure pattern)

### Optional but Helpful ($10-15 additional)

- ☑ Foam pad (protects work surface)
- ☑ Nail set (for precise hammering)
- ☑ Paint/stain for board (decorative finish)
- ☑ Protractor (for marking pin positions)
- ☑ Tablet/phone holder (for viewing TXT instructions)

### What You Already Have

Don't buy everything new! Most people already own:

- Ruler or measuring tape
- Pencil and eraser
- Scissors
- Printer (for TXT file and pattern)

**Total first project cost:** $20-40 depending on what you have.

## Step-by-Step: Your First Build

### Phase 1: Prepare (30 minutes)

**1. Generate your design** (5 min)

- Upload image to [our editor](/editor)
- Set pins: 150-200
- Set lines: 2,000-3,000
- Export TXT file (this is your instruction manual)

**2. Prepare the board** (15 min)

- Sand rough edges if needed
- Optional: Paint or stain (let dry completely)
- Mark center point with pencil
- Draw circle outline (use string compass method)

**3. Print your guides** (10 min)

- Print the TXT file (2-3 pages typically)
- Print a reference image of the design
- Optional: Print pin numbering diagram

### Phase 2: Install Pins (30-45 minutes)

**1. Calculate pin spacing**

```
Circle circumference = π × diameter
Spacing = circumference ÷ pin_count

Example for 18" circle, 180 pins:
18" × 3.14159 = 56.5"
56.5" ÷ 180 = 0.314" between pins
```

**2. Mark pin positions**

- Start at top (12 o'clock = Pin #0)
- Use protractor to mark every X degrees
- Or use string/paper strip method
- Number lightly with pencil (1, 2, 3...)

**3. Hammer nails**

- Go ⅜" deep (leave ⅜" exposed)
- Keep perpendicular to board
- Maintain consistent height
- Double-check numbering as you go

**Pro tip:** Hammer every 10th nail first to ensure spacing is correct before
committing to all pins.

### Phase 3: String the Pattern (2-3 hours)

**1. Setup your workspace**

- Good lighting is CRITICAL
- Comfortable seating
- TXT file visible (tablet/printed)
- Thread spool accessible

**2. Start stringing**

```
TXT file format:
0 → 87
87 → 134
134 → 23
...

Read as: "From pin 0, go to pin 87"
          "From pin 87, go to pin 134"
```

**3. Stringing technique**

- Tie thread to first pin (double knot)
- Pull snug but not tight (prevents board warping)
- Wrap once around each pin
- Follow TXT instructions sequentially
- DON'T SKIP STEPS

**4. Maintain tension**

- Thread should be taut but not guitar-string tight
- Consistent tension = even appearance
- If thread breaks: knot at current pin, continue

**5. Track your progress**

- Highlight completed lines in TXT file
- Take breaks every 500 lines
- Check overall appearance periodically

### Phase 4: Finish (15 minutes)

**1. Secure the end**

- Tie off at final pin (triple knot)
- Cut excess thread
- Optional: Add tiny dot of clear glue to knot

**2. Trim loose ends**

- Cut starting thread tail close to knot
- Remove any stray thread bits

**3. Clean up**

- Gently blow away sawdust/debris
- Wipe board edges with slightly damp cloth
- Let dry completely

**4. Mount or display**

- Add hanging hardware to back
- Or prop on easel/shelf
- Keep out of direct sunlight (thread fades)

## Common Beginner Mistakes (and Fixes)

### Mistake 1: Pins at Different Heights

**Problem:** Uneven nail depth creates messy appearance  
**Prevention:** Use nail set tool for consistent depth  
**Fix:** Gently tap higher nails until even (if thread not yet added)

### Mistake 2: Thread Too Tight

**Problem:** Board warps, pins pull out, thread breaks  
**Prevention:** Pull snug, not tight - should have slight give  
**Fix:** If board warps, loosen all threads slightly, flip board to counter-warp

### Mistake 3: Losing Your Place

**Problem:** Don't know which line you're on in TXT file  
**Prevention:** Highlight each completed line immediately  
**Fix:** Count back visible threads, find last confirmed position

### Mistake 4: Pin Numbering Confusion

**Problem:** Pins numbered incorrectly, pattern looks wrong  
**Prevention:** Double-check every 10th pin during installation  
**Fix:** Start over with nailing (painful but necessary)

### Mistake 5: Running Out of Thread

**Problem:** Thread spool empty mid-project  
**Prevention:** Buy 3 spools for 150-pin project  
**Fix:** Tie new thread to current pin, continue (knot barely visible in final
piece)

### Mistake 6: Image Too Dark/Light

**Problem:** Final result doesn't match preview  
**Prevention:** Pre-process image with high contrast  
**Fix:** Not fixable after stringing - learn for next project

## Realistic Timeline

**First project (150 pins, 2,500 lines):**

- Design generation: 30 min
- Board prep + painting: 1-2 hours (+ drying time)
- Pin installation: 45 min - 1 hour
- Stringing: 2.5-3.5 hours
- Finishing: 15 min

**Total active time:** 5-7 hours  
**Spread over:** 1-2 days (accounting for paint drying)

**Second project:** Cut time by 30% (you know the process)  
**Fifth project:** Cut time by 50% (you've developed rhythm)

## Tips from Experienced Makers

### Before You Start

> "Print the TXT file in large font (14pt). Your eyes will thank you after 2,000
> lines." - Sarah M., string artist

> "Test your thread on one pin first. Some threads are too thin/thick for your
> nail gauge." - James K., maker

### During Stringing

> "Every 500 lines, stand back 6 feet and evaluate. It's easy to miss mistakes
> up close." - Emily R., crafter

> "Use your non-dominant hand to hold thread taut while wrapping. Creates muscle
> memory." - David L., teacher

### After Completion

> "Spray with clear acrylic sealer to prevent dust buildup and thread
> fraying." - Lisa T., professional

> "Photograph in natural light near a window. Flash photography loses the
> texture." - Mike P., photographer

## When Things Go Wrong

### Thread Breaks Mid-Project

**Don't panic.** This happens to everyone.

1. Tie off broken end at nearest pin
2. Cut new thread length (6-8 feet)
3. Tie new thread to same pin
4. Continue from next instruction
5. Trim excess from both knots

The knots are nearly invisible in the final piece.

### Pattern Looks Wrong

**Stop at 500 lines to evaluate.**

If it looks nothing like the preview:

- Check pin numbering (most common culprit)
- Verify you're following TXT in order
- Confirm thread color matches design

If pattern looks light:

- Normal at early stages
- Darkness builds progressively
- Trust the process until 60% complete

### Want to Quit

**Taking breaks is normal and healthy.**

If frustrated:

- Stop at the end of any line (not mid-line)
- Cover project with cloth (prevents dust)
- Return next day with fresh eyes
- Remember: Thousands before you finished successfully

## After Your First Project

### Evaluate Honestly

What went well?  
What was harder than expected?  
What would you change next time?

### Level Up Gradually

**Second project upgrades:**

- ↑ 200-250 pins (slight detail increase)
- ↑ 3,000-3,500 lines (richer depth)
- Try different thread color
- More complex subject

**Don't jump to:**

- 400 pins yet (too big a leap)
- Full-color portraits
- Massive sizes (harder to manage)
